## A Basic, Alpha Blending, Picture Slideshow

### Description

This is a great example of how to resize images into pictureboxes, queue any number of images in the form of a slideshow, and alpha blend each consecutive images to create a fading effect between pictures. The program interface itself isn't designed to be attractive, but instead to teach the different aspects of the program -- you should find that the code is heavily commented. Any comments and votes would be extremely appreciated.
